# SeoBot Article Sync Rule

- The core project goal is to sync SeoBot generated articles, accessed via API, to the database
- All articles must be fetched from the SeoBot API and stored using Prisma ORM
- Ensure robust error handling and logging for all sync operations
- No mock data or fallbacks; show errors if data is unavailable
- Articles must be indexed and optimized for SEO in the database
